# Wine-Quality-Analysis Project

Machine learning algorithms were applied in this project to find the quality of red and white wine. The suitable dataset was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009), preprocessing steps were performed on the data and subsequently, the dataset was split into training and testing sets and machine learning model(s) were applied. Initially, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN, and Naive Bayes models are applied to find the wine quality. The findings were summarized in a comprehensive report. In conclusion, Random Forest emerged as a robust and reliable choice, exhibiting consistent and commendable performance across various quality levels. Its ability to navigate complex data and generalize well makes it a strong contender for wine quality classification tasks. 

There is project can be further modified by exploring advanced techniques like feature scaling, normalization, or even exploring different encoding methods for categorical variables that could enhance the dataset's quality. Exploring other algorithms beyond those already used can be taken into consideration. Ensemble methods like Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) might offer improved accuracy. Furthermore, hyperparameter tuning using different techniques for different machine learning algorithms could optimize the models for better performance.
